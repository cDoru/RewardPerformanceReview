# Full Stack Developer Challenge

## Requirements
Design a web application that allows employees to submit feedback toward each
other&#39;s performance review.
Partial solutions are acceptable. It is not necessary to submit a complete solution that implements every requirement.

### Admin view
- Add/remove/update/view employees
- Add/update/view performance reviews
- Assign employees to participate in another employee&#39;s performance review

### Employee view
- List of performance reviews requiring feedback
- Submit feedback

## Challenge Scope
- High level description of design and technologies used
- Server side API (using a programming language and/or framework of your
choice)
- Implementation of at least 3 API calls
- Web app
    - Implementation of 2-5 web pages using a modern web framework
(preferably Angular 2) that talks to server side
- This should integrate with your API, but it&#39;s fine to use static
responses for some of it
- Document all assumptions made
- Complete solutions aren&#39;t required, but what you do submit needs to run.

## How to complete this challenge
Create Repro on Github or BitBucket â€“ with public access so our developers
can review
- Complete the design and code as defined to the best of your abilities
- Place notes in your code to help with clarity where appropriate. Make it
readable enough to present to the Reward Interview team
- Complete your work in your own github repo and send the results to us and/or present them during your interview

# What are we looking for? What does this prove?
Assumptions you make given limited requirements
- Technology and design choices
- Identify areas of your strengths
- This is not a pass or fail test, this will serve as a common ground that we can deep dive together into specific issues
